class Event(object):
    """
    A class to handle timing and recurrence of games, naming them events.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    
    _timestamp     ::  time at which event is planned to start
    _callback      ::  performs some action, eg. check_waiting_queue in Event.recurring(60, self.check_waiting_queue, True)
    _on_done       ::  lambda function as function parameter, e.g. lambda: self.send_typing(chat_id)
    _every         ::  int (seconds)
    _recurring     ::  bool, tells if event is recurring or not
    _daytime_only  ::  bool,
    

    Methods
    -------
    __init__     :: creates new Events instance 
    __call__     :: call instance as a function
    when         :: return timestamp (when event is planned)
    is_recurring :: returns bool _recurring 
    recurse      :: sets new timestamp calculated from _every and current time
    set_every    :: sets event attribute _every and first occurrence of event (now + every)
    after        :: create event instance of event after seconds seconds
    recurring    :: create event instance of recurring event that repeats after every seconds
    
    Python time function time.time() returns the exact seconds (with many digits) since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00
